# Decentralised Application
This project utilizes the power of blockchain technology to create a transparent and tamper-proof system for logging the details of users who have generously donated to our smart contract. Whether it's real Ether (ETH) or test Ether (like Goerli Eth).

Here's how it works:

* You need to have metamask wallet installed in your browser.

* Then register your wallet address on this app to get started.

* Contribute Ether to this app securely and effortlessly.

* Every donation, along with the user's wallet address, is immutably recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.
